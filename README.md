# SMS-Spam-Classifier
A basic classifier to assess if an SMS is a spam or not.
Data come from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) and are stored in file "spambase.data". Documentation can be found in files "spambase.DOCUMENTATION" and "spambase.names".
This project aims at practicing new knowledge learned in Udemy course "Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python" and in Kaggle. A Naive Bayes approach will be conducted, followed by an artificial neural network. Maybe other models will be assessed in the future.
A Jupyter notebook will also be written.
